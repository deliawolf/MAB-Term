# MAB-Term

There are many devices connected to the enterprise network that do not support 802.1X authentication. These devices should not be exempt from authenticating before being allowed to access the network. MAC Authentication Bypass (MAB) is an alternate authentication method that can be used when devices do not support other authentication methods.

MAB has the following characteristics:

1. Uses a MAC address for both username and password

2. Basic authentication for endpoints incapable of 802.1X

3. No authentication or encryption, easily spoofed
